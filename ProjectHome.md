Mobile agent is a peace of code that works as a agent for the user and travels host to host saving its status using serialization. It checks the e commerce offers and choose the best offers. Mobile agent returns these offers to the user when the user log in and see his mobile agent.

Mobile agents are the future of the e commerce. Its requirement can be understood by the following example.

> Ramesh is a sales executive and he travels several places and could not stay online all the time. He comes online for a short time and he need to plan his next months holiday trip with his family. For that trip he need to check the fairs, hotel accommodation and shopping plan of some specific things. As we can understand the Ramesh need to check the internet regularly to check the time specific offers several times before starting his trip.

> If there is some Mobile agent which can do all this for Ramesh and show him the best offers when he come online, it would be very helpful for Ramesh.

> The mobile agent is supposed to do all the above tasks. I have read about a java framework jade to make the agents. I dont have much idea to make this agent but I have determined to make this project. I am going to learn a lot during this project.
